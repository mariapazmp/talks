# Talks & Material
As you may know, make a talk is an enrichment experience that drives you into a two way learning moment, and also, it's a great opportunity to share something that you already know, or go deep into some area where you already have the basis.

*When you teach, you learn twice.*

Here you can find the slides and complement material of my tech talks.
